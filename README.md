In this task, you will implement your first Portfolio Project. This project is a customization of the project you were implementing during the whole Django module.

Take this task seriously, because this project will be attached to your CV as the 1st project.

Task:
1. Choose 1 and only 1 project from the options, given to you in the Theory tab of this topic. 
Be sure, that the option is interesting for you.

2. Create your own public repo on your GitHub account. Name it corresponding to your selected project. 
Important switch to the develop branch for implementing the project functionality. 
You will have to create a PR from the develop to the main branch and attach it as a solution to this task.

3. Implement the project, using the Taxi Service project as an example, of what should be done. 
Important Make sure to name your commits properly - we will check the namings of your commits. 
And after each change to your project (creating a new HTML page, implementing new models or views) - please,
make a commit with the proper name.

4. Think about the implementation of optional parts, given for each possible project. If they are interesting for you - implement them also.

5. Make your project looks better - for that use Bootstrap, or any other HTML/CSS framework. Also, a good option is to re-use some page layouts from one of the Bootstrap-Django templates from the Useful links in the theory tab.

6. Create Pull Request from the develop branch to the main branch of your own repo.

7. Attach screenshots of every page of your custom project. If you've added new functionality or implemented something optional - write a short description in the PR, of what you've done. If you've added new models or changed DB-structure - it is obligatory to add the DB-structure diagram (create it using draw.io).

8. Attach the link to this PR as a solution.
